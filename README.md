# Credit-card-approval-prediction
The purpose of this project is to use credit scoring techniques that assess the risk in lending to a particular client and build a scorecard model. Credit scoring means applying a statistical model to assign a risk score to a credit application and it is a form of Artificial Intelligence, based on predictive modelling, that assesses the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a credit obligation, becoming delinquent or insolvent.

Setting up a credit scorecard to automate even a partial percentage of new customer account decisions is a smart way to strike the right balance between managing risk and optimizing resources.

The first step to creating a credit scorecard is to define what the scorecard should predict. There are two main categories of bad accounts that credit managers aim to avoid – those that pay slowly (but will eventually pay, whether it’s 30, or 60 days late) and those that file for bankruptcy or go out of business (and will never be able to pay). This requires a general understanding of a company’s bad accounts in order to choose which data elements make the most sense for the scorecard.
